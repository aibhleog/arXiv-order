General comments about benty-fields
------------------------

1. benty-fields organized papers as suggestions based upon voting history and chosen preferences.  There's a machine learning component folded in as well.  So the votes from these papers could be considered a control sample of some kind, perhaps?
2. the total votes for papers can only be seen in the "Most Popular" page (with the voting frequencies of "last week", "last month", "last 6 months", and "last year").  The votes for a paper do not come up via the benty-search.
3. "last year" is not an option currently
